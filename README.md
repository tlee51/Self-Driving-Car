# Self-Driving-Car
Simulation of a self-driving car using neural networks and machine learning.

Created a self-driving car simulation by implementing a neural network to make car control itself. 
Created a neural network using Javascript with no libraries.

Implemented components step-by-step: car driving mechanics, environment, sensors, collision detection, car self-control using neural network.
Artificial neural network based on real neural networks in our brain, with visualization.
